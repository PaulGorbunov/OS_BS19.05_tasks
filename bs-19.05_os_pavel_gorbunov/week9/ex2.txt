Sequence of references :

1 2 3 4 5 4 7 3 2 1 3 2 5 6 1 4 8 5 9 1 2 3 4 5 0 3 5 4 1 2 0 5 3 2 4 10 1 5 6 12 3 4 3 2 5 1 12 3

will result in increasing the hit/miss ratio in case there would be more then 5-page frames.
In this example the most used pages are 1 2 3 4 5. So they will be in the main memory for the most of the time.
That is why the miss will happen not so often.

As for the sequence:

4 3 5 6 7 2 10 8 9 1 5 13 78 21 9 4 8 10 1 5 2 13 97 64 101 72 3 10 2 9 1 50 8 25 43 19 87 48 90 65

There is no dominant group of pages, that is used much more often than others,
so this set of references will not be efficient, as there would be a lot of page replacements
between main memory and disk.


So the kind of set that will be efficient for the aging algorithm is the set which has a group of references,
which are used most of the time (they would be in main memory most of the time),
and a group of references, that does not occur often in the reference set 
(this pages may occur page replacement between main memory and disk, but as they occur in set rarely,
the algorithm will still be efficient).
